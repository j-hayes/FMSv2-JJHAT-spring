Entities:

Some of the entities such as FacilityUsage or MaintenanceRequest "have" other objects. 1toM relationships. I think for the entity classes it is probably safer
to just store the ID of the other entity. Entities shouldn't beable to retreive other entities. If we want to use this pattern than we will need to create manager classes
that will fill these entities

ie: FacilityUsage Mannager will use the DAL to populate a FacilityUsage object with both FacilityUsage's attributes as well as a Facility object and a Facility User object.
